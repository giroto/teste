Name	text	my	at	element_id	The name column is a human readable name, and is arbitrary. The text column is what will show in the callout. The obscured element_id column is a jquery selectory for the desired element, ask a developer to do this for you. The at and my position columns are based on the positioning system described here: http://qtip2.com/options#position. This spreadsheet is sorted from top to bottom. This means that if more than the maximum number of callouts could be shown on a given page, only the first n (n <= maximum) callouts will be show. The remaining callouts will be shown later.
